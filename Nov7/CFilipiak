Go to Scratch for Budding Computer Scientists (link on bit.ly/SAHSCS) and answer the
following questions.

You will need to create a file that is named your username and paste your answers in it.
After you have completed the questions, submit a pull request in this same repository.

1) Why is there such a "learning curve" when learning a traditional programming
language such as Java?
It involves learning to read and write a new language. 

2) What is learning to program ultimately about?
Learning to logically solve problems and approach them methodically. 

3) How does Scratch "lower the bar" to programming?
It allows computer scientist to focus on problems rather than syntax.

4) What is a statement in a programming language?
A derective that tells the computer to do something. 

5) What is a Boolean expression?
An expression that is either true or false.

6) What is a conditional statement?
Something that must be true in order to happen.

7) What is a loop used for in a programming language?
It incvolves using multiple executions of statements. 

8) What is the difference between a local variable and a global variable?
Local - used by just one sprite
Global - used by all of your sprites
9) What is a Boolean variable?
A variable that only takes a value of true or false. 

10) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered threads?
"When" blocks are considered threads.

11) Which type of blocks in Scratch can be considered event handlers?
"Broadcasts" blocks are considered event handlers.

12) How many sprites are implemented in Oscartime?
There are nine sprites implemented. 

13) How many threads are used to display the Oscartime game instructions?
Each sprite uses between one to three threads. 

14) How many threads are used by Oscartime's Oscar sprite?
Three threads are used. 

15) What programming constructs does Scratch NOT support?
Methods, parameters, return values, and inheritance and polymorphism are not supported.
